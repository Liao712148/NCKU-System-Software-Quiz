# NCKU-System-Software-Quiz3

## Introduction
This is a practice to implement several trick of number system and bitwise operation:
* `asr.c`: Implement a cross-platform arithmetic right shift which also supports different data width
* `is_power4.c`: Use gcc built-in to solve leetcode [342. Power of Four](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/)
* `bit_comp.c`: Use gcc built-in to solve leetcode [1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/)
* `first_miss.c`: Solve leetcode problem [41. First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)
* `num_of_step.c`: Use gcc built-in to solve leetcode [1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)
* `gcd.c`: Implement GCD function for 64-bits integers with [Binary GCD Algorithm](https://iq.opengenus.org/binary-gcd-algorithm/)
* `bitarray.c`: Implement [bit array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array) operation with improved speed
